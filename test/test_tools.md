## Mocha: Testing Environment

Mocha comes with tons of great features, the website shows a long list but here are the ones I like the most:

* simple async support, including promises.
* async test timeout support.
* before, after, before each, after each hooks (very useful to clean the environment where each test!).
* use any assertion library you want, Chai in our tutorial.

## Chai: Assertion Library

Chai shines on the freedom of choosing the interface we prefer: **"should", "expect", "assert"** they are all available. I personally use **should** but you are free to check it out the API and switch to the others two. Lastly Chai HTTP addon allows Chai library to easily use assertions on HTTP requests which suits our needs.
